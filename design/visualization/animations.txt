Animation is achieved through using sprite sheets.

A sprite sheet is a grid of images. Each cell is one animation frame. The indexing follows a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order, with top-left being frame 0.

Animation system works like this:
1. Tile size defines frame width/height.
2. Indexing picks frames in sequence (row = action, column = frame). It is possible for one row to contain multiple actions.
3. Duration assigns display time per frame.
4. Looping repeats sequence until stopped.
5. State machine selects which row/sequence to play based on pet state (idle, walk, emote).
6. Offsets/margins adjust spacing between tiles if present.

Output: given a state, play its mapped rowâ€™s frames in order with durations, looping by default, then transition per rules.

Before the animations for a given object finishes, the object will not accept new animation requests.

Duration per frame: 100ms unless otherwise specified.

The following section describes the sprite sheets for each object type.
