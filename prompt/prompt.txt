<Coding Guidelines>
Take a modular development approach and generate clear documentation. Git version control is already initialized. Make Git commits once each module is developed and tested.

Framework:
Electron js with Python modules.

Program Interrupt:
Add try-except to catch any Ctrl-C key presses, if caught, exit application properly.

Shell Commands:
For all shell commands, provide the command and expected results. User will run and report back observations.
</Coding Guidelines>


<Mechanics>
The mechanics or controller of the pet system.

<Visualization>
Interface: At OS-level. No frame. Base layer background should be fully transparent (so other applications and windows remain fully visible). The pet pixmap should be visible and always-on-top (higher than all other applications). Mouse clicks on the pet pixmap should be captured by the application and emote should play, while everywhere else should be click-through.

Visual images and animations to show in different states of the pet defined in the mechanics section.
