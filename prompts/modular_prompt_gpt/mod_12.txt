Module 12 — Chatbox UI

Goal: Skinned chatbox above pet with scroll, input, and replace-on-response.

Prompt to coder
Implement src/chat/chatbox.py:
	•	Paint chatbox using provided sprite asset. Two sections: header (pet name) and body (scrollable text area).
	•	Open on double-click, close on double-click.
	•	Enter key sends text to Chat engine (Module 13). After response, replace body with response. Clicking body clears and focuses input.
	•	Chatbox and pet move together on drag.

Files:
	•	src/chat/chatbox.py
Tests:
	•	Text wraps, scroll works, no overlap with pet pixmap.
