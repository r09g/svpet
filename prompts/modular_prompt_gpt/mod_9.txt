Module 9 — Mood and Time

Goal: Mood update, decay, daily reset.

Prompt to coder
Implement src/pet/mood.py:
	•	Start mood=50 for new pets.
	•	On each interaction +1, clamp [0,100].
	•	Decay −1 per hour via QTimer aligned to system clock.
	•	On app start or new day boundary: reset to random [40,60].
	•	Expose signals moodChanged(int).

Files:
	•	src/pet/mood.py
Tests:
	•	Force timers with mocked clock. Clamp works.
