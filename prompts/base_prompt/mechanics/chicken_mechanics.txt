State machine for chicken.

states: { IDLE, WALK, SIT, EAT }
init/default: IDLE

if IDLE:
    in IDLE for random([5, 15]) seconds
    randomly goto next state with probabilities: { IDLE: 0.1, WALK: 0.4, SIT: 0.4, EAT: 0.2 }

if WALK:
    randomly determine location on screen and walk manhattan path with minimum turns to location.
    goto IDLE
    
if SIT:
    in SIT for random([10, 30]) seconds
    randomly goto next state with probabilities: { IDLE: 0.4, WALK: 0.1, SIT: 0.4 }

if EAT:
    in EAT for random([3, 10]) seconds
    randomly goto next state with probabilities: { IDLE: 0.4, WALK: 0.3, SIT: 0.3 }
